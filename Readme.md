## 📖 Credits 
This project was heavily inspired by the amazing work of AcciFPV. Their creativity and open sharing within the FPV community motivated me to start developing my own hardware. While this design is fully original, AcciFPV’s approach and passion for innovation definitely sparked many of the ideas behind it. Huge thanks to them for contributing so much to the FPV scene — check out their projects for more awesome stuff!
